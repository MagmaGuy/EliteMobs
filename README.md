# EliteMobs Fork

This is a community-maintained fork of EliteMobs by MagmaGuy. Because he is uninterested in accepting contributions, I have started this fork as a place where collaboration can occur on the plugin moving forward.

## Features

* Mobs - Variety of Elite bosses with unique powers, loot, and combat mechanics
* Loot - Custom loot tables, procedurally generated items, custom enchantments, potion effects
* Custom Bosses - When the built-in bosses don't provide enough challenge or customization!
* Dungeons - Spawn custom mobs in specific worlds
* Difficulty Scaling - Spawns mobs based on the quality of your gear

## Roadmap

* MySQL Support
* Performance improvements
* NPE audit
